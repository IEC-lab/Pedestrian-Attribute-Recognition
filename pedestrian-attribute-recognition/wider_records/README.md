This repository re-implements the ECCV 2018 paper [Deep Imbalanced Attribute Classification using Visual Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03903) 

# Development Environment

* Python 3.5

* MXNet with CUDA-9
```
$ pip install --upgrade mxnet-cu90
```
* Add project path to ```PYTHONPATH```
```
$ export PYTHONPATH=/project/path:$PYTHONPATH
$ cd /project/path
```

# Download Datasets

* WIDER-Attribute: The original images and the annotation files are provided [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERAttribute.html), cropped images for each human bounding box can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/zhufengx/SRN_multilabel). 28,340 cropped images in "train" and "val" for training, 29,177 cropped images in "test" for testing.


# Prepare Data

All records, list and txt files should be provided in the `wider_records/` folder

# Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models should be placed in the saved_models/. Comment-in the lines that fetch pre-trained models the first time you train it. Then save the corresponding models to the folder. 

## WIDER-Attribute

* Place the WIDER-Attribute dataset under the path `/dataset/path/WIDER/`. Then copy paste the images and rename as before to `Image_cropped/`. 

* Call the `resize_images` function from `preprocessing/` to resize all images to 256x256 and save them. 

* Place the downloaded annotation text files under `/dataset/path/WIDER/wider_att/`.

* Call the `data_prep` function from `preprocessing/` to obtain the image and annotation files and save them to .lst files. 

* From the initial MXNet download you should be able to find in the `tools/` the `im2rec.py` [file](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tools/im2rec.py). Open a terminal and type:

```
$ cd /incubator-mxnet/tools/
$ python im2rec.py /project/path/DeepVisualAttributes /dataset/path/WIDER --quality=100 --pack-label=True
```

This will create the record files to `wider_records/` to feed to the iterator.

## Run the Code

* Run `main.py`. Remember to provide as an input argumenet the data path.
